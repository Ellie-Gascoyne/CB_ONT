# Script Ideas 
This markdown file can be used to collborate on the workflow script, as well as notes on working in bash

## Working in bash
Bash (Bourne Again shell) is a shell that can be used on macOS. You can also run Z Shell (Zsh) which is the default for later mac software that can autocorrect for commands, and more powerful auto-completion.

To change the shell from zsh to bash, run the following command in the terminal:

```
chsh -s /bin/bash
```
This can be changed back to zsh by using the same command but change 'bash' to 'zsh'. 

Other common commands for bash include listing all files and directories for current directory 

```
ls
```
making a new directory:
```
mkdir directory_name
```
navigating directories:
```
cd /path/to/directory
```
displaying current directory
```
pwd
```
removing files:
```
rm file_name.txt
```
Finding files:
```
find /path-name "filename"
```
